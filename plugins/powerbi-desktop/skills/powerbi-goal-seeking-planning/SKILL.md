# Power BI Goal-Seeking Planning

Use this skill when the question is "What must happen to hit the target?" rather than "What will happen?"

## Workflow

1. Select target: budget, roll forecast, prior year, management target, margin, or cash.
2. Calculate current plan gap by month.
3. Decompose the required change:
   - actual-to-date contribution
   - expected backlog conversion
   - residual demand required
   - customer/product gap drivers
4. Rank feasible levers:
   - improve conversion
   - pull forward backlog
   - recover customer demand
   - substitute product/customer demand
   - challenge the target if infeasible
5. Label target feasibility:
   - `achievable`
   - `stretch`
   - `unlikely`
   - `not_supported_by_data`

## Required outputs

- `forecast_month`
- `target_name`
- `target_value`
- `current_forecast`
- `target_gap`
- `required_backlog_conversion`
- `required_residual_demand`
- `top_required_segments`
- `feasibility`
- `explanation`

## Guardrails

- Do not treat target closure as evidence that the target is realistic.
- Separate mathematically required revenue from operationally feasible revenue.
